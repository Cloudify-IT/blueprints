# This is an inputs file for the tutorial-blueprint.yaml. Many of these inputs have default values in the blueprint itself.
## However, there are some that have no defaults and you will need to fill them out with your own values, i.e. your credentials.

## You need to provide these. There's no way I can know the default values.
aws_access_key_id: ''
aws_secret_access_key: ''

## You also need to provide this. There's a good chance that us-east-1 will work for you, so I provided a default.
## This places the server in Ireland region of AWS (If you change this, Confirm that the AMI is avalible in the new region)
ec2_region_name: eu-west-1
## Especially because I know the AMIs below work in eu-west-1.

# The following values have default values, but if you want to use an existing Instance,
# Security Group or IP or Keypair, I've exposed them as inputs for you.
# use_existing_security_group_for_monitoring: false

# use_existing_keypair: false

## If you will change these in the tutorial-blueprint.yaml, and in the start.sh, then you should change these.
